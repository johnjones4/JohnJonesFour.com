### Ideation: Feedly, TweetDeck, and Pocket

I'm constantly following the day's news on both [TweetDeck](http://tweetdeck.com) where I have lists setup for world and national news, local news, industry news, and others and on [Feedly](http://feedly.com) where I'm following numerous news, industry, and culture feeds. When I find an article I want to save for later, I clip it using [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/).

### Writing: Evernote and Moeditor

I'll use [Evernote](http://evernote.com) to track article ideas and notes and [Moeditor](https://moeditor.org/) to compose posts. I write most of my posts on this site in the formatting markup Markdown.

### The Site: Atom, Jekyll and S3

This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site hosted by [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). The site's theme is a combination of [Start Bootstrap's "Clean Blog" theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) and my own minor tweaks. I do all of my coding in [Atom](https://atom.io/). In addition, I use the projects [GitHub-jQuery-Repo-Widget](https://github.com/JoelSutherland/GitHub-jQuery-Repo-Widget) by Joel Sutherland and [gist-embed](https://github.com/blairvanderhoof/gist-embed) by Blair Vanderhoof to power the GitHub widgets you see throughout the site.
