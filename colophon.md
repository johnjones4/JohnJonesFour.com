### Ideation: Wunderlist, Evernote, and Pocket

Often times I'll come across an article or snippet online that sparks an idea for a post. I'll use [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) to record those snippets using a separate blog notebook in the app, and I keep a separate todo list in [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/) specifically with blog topic ideas. Once I feel I have enough material or a complete thought on a topic, I'll tackle writing the post. I also use [Pocket](http://getpocket.com/) to track my reading list.

### Writing: iA Writer Pro and Sublime Text 3

I write all of my posts on this site in the formatting markup Markdown. I'll use [iA Writer Pro](https://ia.net/writer/mac) to compose posts and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) to manage the articles within the site.

### The Site: Jekyll and S3

This is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) site hosted using [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). The site's theme is a combination of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and my own minor tweaks.
