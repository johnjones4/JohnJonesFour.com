title: "Lean Into Your Side Projects"
description: "Side projects offer freedom of creation and exploration to developers, which is a needed creative outlet."

There's a common refrain in
software among engineers when they see a product that interests them: "I could build that." The phrase captures
a lot about what's going on in that their heads the instant they utter
it. At first, it seems to be a statement of boasting â€“ that they
feel they are just as good (or better) than whoever made the original
product. Thinking deeper, it's a personal challenge they submit to
themselves as a test of their meddle as creators to see how they compare
against another. Ultimately, it's a sign of someone who is always
thinking creatively about the why and the how of the way things work,
and it's a mindset to be encouraged. However, rarely in the course of daily work do developers have the opportunity to freely explore their own "I could build that" notions.
This is why we should lean into our side projects.

"Side project" can have a few interpretations, and I do not mean for
this to be confused with a term like "side hustle" which implies a
stronger business effort. While they can overlap, what I'm referring to
here is a project that is wholly owned by its creator. It's not
something that is not meant to be a contribution to a broader community
and it therefore is something that can exist mostly independent of
external controls. The inspiration for a side project can come from
anywhere. Maybe it's born out of an "I could build that" reaction
whereby a developer simply tries to see if they can make a slight
improvement, or maybe it's a more original, albeit esoteric, solution to
a personal inconvenience. Either way, it's important that the creator of
a side project feel a deep sense of ownership of the project's
direction.

I'm not the first to take a stance on side projects. Proponents have told me they
help developers build valuable skills and they're a way to take part in
the vast open source ecosystem. Critics have said to me that developers need to take
a break and enjoy living outside of their machines for a while, and that side projects are simply a waste of energy if they benefit only their creators. I agree that there must be moderation
between screen time and "everything else." [I've advocated for
that](https://johnjonesfour.com/2020/01/24/go-analog/). However, I think side projects offer more benefit than detriment when done for the right reasons.

What I'm talking about with side projects is the creative
outlet they offer. As engineers, we're constantly tasked with solving
complex problems within an organizational framework. In this environment,
we must build things according to what the team designs, which often is
exciting but is also sometimes constraining. With the diverse experience and
views of a team, there is potential to build great products, but
that also takes away a freedom to implement zany ideas and open
exploration.

A side project offers that freedom. As something wholly owned by its
creator and designed almost exclusively to solve its creator's needs,
it's something that isn't meant to provide the scalable value of a
regular software product, but it does provide immense value to its
creator in the solution it provides and the freedom it grants. The
utility others may find in it as a product or open source project is
extraneous, and sometimes publicizing a side project is detrimental to
the direct value it provides to its creator because those outside
influences ultimately can take away that sense of ownership. That is
something to decide on a case-by-case basis.

I have some side projects that I've turned into "mini" products because
I wanted them to provide value to others while some other projects I've
kept as purely personal endeavors. To illustrate some examples, I have a
[small open source project that's a "web clipping"
extension](https://github.com/johnjones4/Standard-Notes-Clipper) for the
open source app, [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/). Initially,
I simply created it because that was a feature I needed for Standard
Notes, and luckily that project has a highly enthusiastic and welcoming
creator and community who've helped me expand the project. On the other
hand, I cobbled together a Raspberry-Pi [personal dashboard
project](https://www.hackster.io/johnjones4/dresser-top-dashboard-913ed3),
which I shared as an open source project, but ultimately did nothing
strongly promote its use among others. The reason is that it's an
ultra-specific solution that I regularly tweak for no one but myself
because no one but myself needs this exact thing. Again, side projects
are to fulfill their creators' needs and curiosities first.

Like many personal endeavors, there're few "wrong ways" to do a side
project. Side projects should scratch an itch, and the minute they stop
doing that, it's ok to abandon them. Move on to the next thing that
excites you, empowers you, and makes you excited to create.
