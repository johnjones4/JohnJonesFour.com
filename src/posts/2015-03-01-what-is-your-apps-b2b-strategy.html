<p>Google's recent <a href="http://officialandroid.blogspot.com/2015/02/android-is-ready-for-work.html">Android for Work</a> announcement opens up a new opportunity for app developers to produce useful, profitable Android apps to be used for business. However, marketing to businesses is different than marketing to consumers. While Apple has been in the business app space for a few years with its <a href="http://www.apple.com/business/vpp/">Volume Purchase Program for Business</a>, it is now easier for app publishers to craft effective dual-platform B2B app strategies with both major platforms in play.</p>

<h3>Evaluating the B2B App Space</h3>

<p>While B2B business can be extremely profitable, expectations of quality and support are far higher than they are in the consumer product space. When considering product directions for your business app, consider the long-term costs of support that might go along with it. Businesses expect that any cost should either facilitate business development or optimize existing practices. If your app creates more barriers than it knocks-down by being difficult to use or by being not quite the best-fit solution, then your app will not survive.</p>

<p>You will likely find that there will never be a one-size fits-all solution for the particular problem you think you can solve, and so your go to market strategy might evolve into more of a solutions provider than a product manufacturer. The best way to begin this analysis is to speak with people who've been in the space of the problem you're trying to solve. They can share with you what has worked, what hasn't worked, and what the keys to success are.</p>

<h3>Enrolling in <em>Google for Work | Android</em> and Apple's <em>Volume Purchase Program for Business</em></h3>

<p>After crafting an idea for an app or solution that you think will flourish as a B2B product, you must enroll in Google's new <a href="https://www.google.com/work/android/partners/#partner:form">partner program for business Android</a>. If you're already own an Apple developer account, then you're ready for their existing <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/volume/">Volume Purchase Program for Business</a>.</p>

<h3>Developing a B2B Marketing Strategy</h3>

<p>While B2B marketing has established best-practices and standard tactics, you need to analyze how those activities can translate into promoting your app. Often used practices in the B2B space such as white-papers, sales staff, and content marketing. The chief thing to remember in B2B marketing is that the concentration is no longer on consumers who make autonomous purchasing decisions. Rather, the marketing concentrates on key decision makers who evaluate and deploy solutions on behalf of a group of end-users.</p>

<p>Traditional B2B business models allocate a lesser budget to traditional marketing tactics such as social media and more to relationship building tactics, but as the mobile-apps-for-business space evolves, we may see more tactics borrowed from consumer-oriented marketing that are used to build a brand identity for mobile apps. However despite that influence of B2C, it is important to remember that relationship building with potential customers is the principal driver of B2B sales.</p>
