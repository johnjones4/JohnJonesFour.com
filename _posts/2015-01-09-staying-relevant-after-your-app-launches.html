<p>You must keep the momentum alive for your app after launch. Without persistent attention to your app’s promotion, you’ll quickly see a drop in downloads and a falling store ranking. Prevent that with these few tips that will keep your app on the mind of current users and prospective users.</p>

<h3>Keep Using Those Promo Codes</h3>
<p>Apple bumping up the number of promotional codes that app developers can circulate was a boon to app marketers. With that in mind, reserving a few promotional codes during launch for a later date can be helpful when you need to restart some reviewer momentum after your first few months in the app store.</p>

<h3>Make Alliances</h3>
<p>Blogs, newsletters, and other media outlets can all be potential partners. Anyone who likes your app can become an ally willing to help promote it. These alliances are built through trades of services, sharing of promotional space, and just plain friendship. Building as many of these builds your apps credibility and SEO.</p>

<h3>Pitch Bloggers and Reviewers</h3>
<p>Pitching the media and reviewers never ends. As you add new features and release updates to your app, you also need to constantly make noise about it. No matter what the feature is, you should always push out a short press release to your followers and reviewers announcing the release.</p>

<h3>Have a Features Roadmap</h3>
<p>If you’re a small team or a single person producing a new app, throwing the kitchen sink into your v1’s feature set can be a poor mistake. This is because as a small team, you have very few resources to predict the true needs and expectations of your users – much less do any sort of true usability tests to determine this. So rather than weigh version one down with features that might not get used, build a features roadmap so that you can continually build-in those features based on user feedback over the course of the app’s lifespan. By doing that, you’ll always have something new and relevant to pitch to reviewers and other media outlets.</p>

<h3>Speaking Engagements</h3>
<p>Local developer and mobile app groups love new speakers. Go and talk to those groups about an interesting engineering problem you overcame with a creative solution or some sort of viral marketing effort that took off around your app. Giving back to your local developer community is a another great way to build alliances that can then contribute to growth in downloads and community accolades.</p>

<h3>Ask Users to Review Your App</h3>
<p>A common design pattern in apps now is to ask users to review the app after x number of uses or x days after installing. Unfortunately, this pattern can result in negative reviews. Instead, you should ask users after a certain time whether or not they like your app. If their answer is yes, then ask them for a review. If the answer is no, ask them to submit feedback as to why they do not like your app. Use the positive review from the happy users as testimonials for promotion, and use the direct feedback to implement new features and refinements.</p>

<h3>Newsjacking</h3>
<p>Having app with a concept or features that align with momentary public interest is a useful – albeit temporary – way to drive downloads. This particularly true for concepts surrounding safety, security, or events. However, you must be careful to be tactful and professional when dealing sensitive news topics.</p>
