My latest project, BackupTool, has really taken off. I've added a new section to the project outlining how contributors can help out with the project. This is my first open source project to get this sort of traction, so it is quite exciting.

Having these sort of guidelines is absolutely crucial for an open-source project. Behind the veil that discussion boards provide to contributors, it is easy to forget the normal courtesies we grant each other when dealing face-to-face. Open source software is a great thing because it not only provides others with valuable tools, but it also gives less-experienced developers a place to grow their talents. With BackupTool, I'd like to foster the sort of environment that welcomes aid and encourages collaboration amongst software developers of all skill levels.
