Doing this will show you how real consumers will interpret your language in the wild.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>After you choose the most effective description for your target audience, thoroughly proof read it for spelling, grammar, and accuracy. </li>\r\n\r\n<li>Prepare your app store keywords using <a href="http://keywordtool.io" target="_blank">keywordtool.io</a> to check them. Make sure to not use stop words and connectors that take up space and use words efficiency. (i.e. 9 instead of nine.)</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Have a privacy policy, especially if you use GPS, contacts, or any other data service in your app and especially if your app is targeted at children. Sites like <a href="http://www.iubenda.com/en" target="_blank">Iubenda</a> and host of other "free privacy policy generator" sites help make this a simple process.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Setup a support-specific email address such as support@myappname.com so that users looking for assistance are not emailing your personal Gmail directly.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Prepare your app landing page for launch.

If you do not already have a landing page for your app setup, you’ll need that before submitting your app for distribution. <a href="https://appblast.io/signup">Create a free landing page</a></li>\r\n\r\n</ul>
