With having \_theInitialCommit rolling and making a personal goal to write more, I was unhappy with the grammar checking tools available in the open source community. There're some great online offerings such as Grammarly and Hemmingway. However there is nothing that works from the command line or one that can run in a build tool such as Grunt.

While this wasn't a problem foremost on my mind, I came across a post by [Matt Might](http://matt.might.net/articles/shell-scripts-for-passive-voice-weasel-words-duplicates/) that detailed how he built some simple proofing tools as Bash scripts. As an attempt to iterate on his work and build in some things that I wanted to see, I created GrammarLint. To learn more about it, check it out on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnjones4/grammarlint).
