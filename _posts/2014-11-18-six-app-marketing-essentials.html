<p>Marketing an app is a pain. After weeks – possibly months – of development and design work that result in awesome, ready to launch product, compiling strong marketing resources is the last thing most developers want to do. However, it is a necessary task if you want to drive downloads, and there a few simple starter-steps that you can do to expedite your launch.</p>

<h3>1. A Value Proposition</h3>
<p>The first step is the hardest. Getting a user to download even a free app is difficult. To encourage that conversion, you must give potential users a clear and meaningful value proposition. This can be or can come from your app’s mission statement or objectives.</p>

<h3>2. Strong Screenshots and Demo Videos</h3>
<p>To reinforce that value proposition, your users need to see your app in action. Strong screenshots, one that highlight the key features of your app, show the users the quality of your work. On top of that, featuring a demo video of the app on your site further communicates that value proposition.</p>

<h3>3. A Landing Page</h3>
<p>You must attract new users through channels outside of the app store. Prior to the app launching, you can use a landing page to attract interest and building a mailing list. After the app launches, it is a tool to feature aspects of your app that cannot be shown in the app store such as different device screenshot and both Google and App Store links.</p>

<h3>4. An Email List & Email Marketing</h3>
<p>Begin marketing your app before you write the first line of code. Do this because even while you are concentrating on building and testing features, you can have a landing page to share that gathers interested users via an email signup. When you’re ready to begin distributing the finished product, you’ll already have a base of early adopter email addresses ready to get on board.</p>

<h3>5. A Healthy Mix of Real User Views and Professional Reviews</h3>
<p>Four and five star reviews inside the Google Play and App Store combined with strong reviews from reputable online reviewers and publications. Garnering good app store reviews is a product of your strategy within the app: ask happy, active users to review and ask occasional, short-session users to explain to you in a feedback form what they don’t like. Review sites are different. Good press with those sites is the result of a good pitch to the right sites.</p>

<h3>6. A Press Release</h3>
<p>Most app developers see the term press release and think of the antiquated image of a black and white photocopy of typewriter-written page. On the contrary, a modern day app press release should lead off with a short description of the app, followed by the app’s value proposition, then a brief description of the app’s features, and completed with a few screenshots of the app on Apple and Android device chrome that you’d like to see featured.</p>
