title:  "Five Things To Consider When Choosing an App Name"
description: "Before you dive into coding your next app, take a moment to carefully consider its name. Both Apple's and Google's marketplaces are saturated with poorly-named apps. Those names blend in to the fabric of the stores and rarely receive a second consideration from users browsing. Avoid that situation by crafting an original and descriptive name that attracts downloading users."

<p>Before you dive into coding your next app, take a moment to carefully consider its name. Both Apple's and Google's marketplaces are saturated with poorly-named apps. Those names blend in to the fabric of the stores and rarely receive a second consideration from users browsing. Avoid that situation by crafting an original and descriptive name that attracts downloading users.</p>

<h3>1. Domain</h3>
<p>Make sure the domain you’re looking for is available. If it is not, it’s also perfectly acceptable to use append suffixes like <em>app</em> onto the end of the domain and to use alternate top level domains such as <em>.io</em> and other newer TLDs such as <em>.mobile</em>. <a href="http://www.namecheap.com/?aff=79966">Check out the great domain options at Namecheap.com.</a></p>

<h3>2. A Tagline To Help Explain</h3>
<p>If you choose a more abstract app name, it’s useful to include a tagline or short phrase the better clarifies the app’s utility. This tagline can then be appended to the name you submit to the app stores.</p>

<h3>3. Fit It On the Screen</h3>
<p>Above all else, make sure the name is less than 11 characters so that it will fit on the launch screen of your users’ devices. This name can be a shortened version of the name you submit to the app store, but it absolutely must fit.</p>

<h3>4. Avoid the Two-Parter</h3>
<p>Two part names such like TimeTracker, NewsWatcher, etc are played. They now harken back to dot-com-bubble sites that used suffixes like <em>works</em> and <em>net</em> to sound contemporary. (Think of the ill-fated GovWorks.) Like those names of the late 90s, two part app names of today all sound the same. It’s just noise in the app store. Cut through that noise with a more unique naming convention to get noticed.</p>

<h3>5. Your Brand goes Beyond the App Store</h3>
<p>Your app doesn’t just exist with the ecosystem of the app store. A good app might compete with a desktop tool or a physical device amongst the Internet of Things. Your app should stand as a unique brand not just in the app store. A good app brand is one which becomes a household name.</p>
