Starting in December, I'll be hosting a series of workshops at the Washington DC branch of General Assembly. The first one will be a short class on getting into web analytics; it's absolutley worth checking out.

### About This Class

> It’s never too late to learn and apply web analytics to your digital program. Whether you’re launching an integrated marketing campaign or simply want to understand audience behavior on your website, it is nearly impossible to measure and communicate success without web analytics. Don’t make the mistake of analyzing metrics at the end of a project; setting specific goals and benchmarks on the front end will help you stay on track (and course correct, if necessary).

>The good news? You don’t have to be a webmaster to integrate analytics into your digital communications project! During this session, we’ll introduce you to concepts behind a sophisticated measurement plan that will help you achieve your intended results. You’ll walk away with a deeper understanding of analytics and a game plan for your next big project.
