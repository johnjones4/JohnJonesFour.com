Give Adfero’s Director of Technology, John Jones, a complex technical problem or a digital strategy challenge, and he will instinctively know how to get to the solution. John, a.k.a “JJ,” lives and breathes websites and mobile apps, and – luckily for us -  has a talent for translating tough concepts and jargon into relatable terms.

Keeping track of state-of-the-art technology, as well as the D.C. communications and political landscape, John shines when collaborating with client partners. “I like giving clients a detailed and comprehensive understanding of their options before proceeding in any one direction,” he said.

John is an avid public speaker and thought leader in the DC tech community. He has presented at General Assembly, Campaigns & Elections CampaignTech and Adfero’s own get{smart} series. In his spare time, John enjoys cooking with his wife, collecting classic rock and jazz LPs and staying an active alumnus with his alma mater, Dickinson College.
