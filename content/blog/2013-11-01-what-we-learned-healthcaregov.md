description: "Anyone who works in an industry even remotely tech-related in Washington DC has repeatedly fielded the recent question, “what do you think of Healthcare.gov?” The news, and its DC-typical host of rumors, consumed this town and this country for a time. The failure of the site to function properly led to decreased public confidence in the new healthcare system established by the Affordable Healthcare Act, and it led to a very humiliating experience for the Obama Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services and the contractors involved, including CGI Federal. However, another tragedy in this family of tragedies is that the Healthcare.gov failure represents a missed chance for the government to set a higher bar for web-based government services."
