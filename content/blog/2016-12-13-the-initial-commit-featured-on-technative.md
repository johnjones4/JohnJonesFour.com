\_theInitialCommit was featured on the site *TechNative* this week. It's been an exciting time for that project as the interest in it seems to grow week over week. I'm also excited to share that Maddison Long, also featured in the article, will be joining the project to help recruit new interview candidates and further promote it.

> But who are these people dedicating so much of their time to collaborative projects? In September 2016, John Jones launched the blog, \_TheInitialCommit, with the goal of it being the medium for which we can discover the personal stories of open source developers. An interview is published every Tuesday, and touches upon everything from his or her backgrounds, to why he or she decided to become a contributor to their respective open source communities.
