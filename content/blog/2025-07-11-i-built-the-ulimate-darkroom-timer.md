Welcome to my film photography sanctuary ‚Äî a custom-built darkroom with a DIY ESP32-powered development timer at its heart. In this video, I‚Äôll give you a full tour of the space I spent years dreaming about and months building.

You‚Äôll learn how I designed my flush-mounted darkroom timer, built a custom epoxy-coated sink, and organized a fully functional 5x10 darkroom with ventilation, water, and light control ‚Äî all tailored for black & white film and paper development.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è What you'll see:

* My DIY light table and Besseler enlarger setup
* A walkthrough of the ESP32-based development timer
* A web-controlled interface for film timing
* How I built and plumbed my own development sink
* Tips for efficient darkroom layout and storage
* STL file links for 3D printed parts (below)

Whether you‚Äôre a fellow film shooter, a DIY tech enthusiast, or just here for the satisfying build footage ‚Äî you‚Äôre in the right place.
