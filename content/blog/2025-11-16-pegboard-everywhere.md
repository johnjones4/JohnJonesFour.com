I completely rebuilt the back wall of my workbench — and the result is a fully custom pegboard system packed with storage for electronics, tools, and all my photography + videography gear.

In this video, I walk through the entire build on John Builds Things: from framing a massive 8' x 2' pegboard panel to routing the edges, adding LED lighting, designing 3D-printed organizers, and wiring everything up with ESPHome and Home Assistant.

If you saw my last video, you may have noticed the new backdrop — today you get the full build!
