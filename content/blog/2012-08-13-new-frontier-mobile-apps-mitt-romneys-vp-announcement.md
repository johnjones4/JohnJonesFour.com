description: "Watching the coverage of Mitt Romney’s just-announced running-mate, Paul Ryan, Saturday morning, I could not help but get excited every time newscasters mentioned “confirmed via the Mitt Romney VP app.” For the first time, an app has been used as an organization’s primary method of pushing news. Not a website, not a Facebook page, but an app was used to break the Apple-like secrecy of Romney’s VP nominee. But did the Romney campaign choose an app just to look more “hip” than the opposition or was there a genuine, strategic purpose for this choice?"
