This is a small data collector and visualization that scans the Twitter API for tweets from presidential candidates, analyzes the N-grams of the tweets, and renders the most popular n-grams based on frequency. The N-gram algorithm is based off of the one found on [Text Mining, Analytics & More](http://www.text-analytics101.com/2014/11/what-are-n-grams.html) and the visualization is built with [D3.js](https://d3js.org/).
