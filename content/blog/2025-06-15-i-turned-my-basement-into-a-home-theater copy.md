Transforming a dusty spare room into a full-blown home movie theater? Challenge accepted.

In this DIY home theater build, I take you behind the scenes of turning our unused basement room into a cozy, cinematic escape ‚Äî complete with a custom starfield ceiling, hunter green walls, and a surround sound system (all using FREE equipment left by the previous owners!).

Whether you're a home improvement junkie, a movie lover, or someone just curious about building your own theater setup on a budget, this project shows what‚Äôs possible with a bit of elbow grease and creativity.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è In this video you'll see:

* The full room transformation from spare room to theater
* How I designed and built a DIY fiber optic star ceiling
* My painting and prep tips for getting that classic theater feel
* How I mounted posters and set up the surround sound system
* The gear I inherited for free (and how I made it all work!)
* Final walkthrough + cinematic tour of the completed room

üé• Shot with time-lapse, voiceover, and lots of practical tips.

This was a true passion project and I hope it inspires your own.
