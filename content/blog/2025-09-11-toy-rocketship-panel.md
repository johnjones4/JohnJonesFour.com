Take imaginative play to the next level 🚀! In this project, I built my 4-year-old a homemade Apollo-inspired rocket control panel using laser-cut acrylic, UV printing, and an Arduino. Complete with flashing lights, toggle switches, and authentic Apollo sound effects, this prototype turned a simple play tent into a full space mission.

Along the way, I learned a lot about laser cutting, UV printing, Arduino coding, and electronics assembly—and I share all the details in this video.

Whether you’re into DIY builds, parenting hacks, Apollo-era nostalgia, or just love space history, this project has something for you. And stay tuned—this is just a prototype for a much bigger build coming soon!
