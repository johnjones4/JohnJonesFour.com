This is my first attempt at a Chrome extension. It loads the latest links from Today in Tabs and displays them in a popup menu. The primary reason that I wrote this was because I had never written a Chrome extension before, but I also wrote this so that I could more quickly get to the links found in [Today in Tabs](http://tinyletter.com/todayintabs).
