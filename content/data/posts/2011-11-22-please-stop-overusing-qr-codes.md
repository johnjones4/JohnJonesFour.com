description: "It’s alright to admit that you’re annoyed by the amount of QR codes used in advertising; we’re all tired of seeing them. Those two dimensional barcodes, or quick response codes (QR Codes), were originally invented to help Toyota track auto parts, but with the advent of high-resolution mobile cameras and the intent of providing consumers with an easy way of accessing information on the go, QR codes are placed on everything from bank ads to cigarette boxes. But, like any fad, they are blindingly too common and implemented too improperly to add any sort of uniqueness to a digital strategy."
