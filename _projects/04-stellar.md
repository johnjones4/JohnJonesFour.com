Stellar is a straightforward App for constellation spotting. It uses the compass and accelerometer combined with a database of all 88 major constellations to display where and what is in the sky.
The star data is brought to you by the SIMBAD database, operated at Centre de Donn√©es astronomiques de Strasbourg, France.
