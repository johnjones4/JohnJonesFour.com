This app is meant to be an educational tool for learning about the fundamentals of computer architecture. It acts as a simple, 16-bit CPU with 16-bit word addressable memory. The instruction set is not complex, but it is powerful. Included with the app are several sample assembler programs you may edit and expand upon as you wish.
