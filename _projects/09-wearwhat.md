It's hard getting dressed in the morning without knowing the weather. You don't have time to wait for the weather report on the morning news, and you sure can't run outside unclothed to see if it's raining. (Trust us, that was a bad idea.) Instead, you can use WearWhat? to get a notification with the weather report at the time you choose.
