In my senior year at Dickinson College, I researched and implemented several shortest-path finding algorithms. This translates directly into route guidance systems employed by mapping websites and in-car GPSes.

The primary point of this research was to learn more about informed graph searches also known as  A* Search, Landmarks, and Triangle inequality search (ALT Search). Research I based this on was originally conducted at Microsoft Research. It is appropriately cited in my report.
