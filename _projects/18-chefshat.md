Here's how the conversation always went:
**My Wife:** Hey, let's make those enchiladas you made that one time.
**Me:** Yeah that's a great idea. Where was that recipe from again?
**My Wife:** I don't remember. You don't remember?
**Me:** Nope ... Wanna just get a pizza?
**My Wife:** ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I love to cook, and I love to find new recipes online. However, I thought there was not an easy way to save my found recipes in a way that made them easy to use again later. Sure, most big food websites have a login feature that let's you bookmark recipes on their site, but keeping recipes siloed within each website is not ideal. Social media sites like Pinterest let you save recipes, but those tools are not tailored to the needs of cooks: easy search of your saved recipes and a readable, useful interface that is optimized for viewing while cooking. All of that is offered by my tool, Chef's Hat

Chef's Hat is a webapp and iOS app that is there to always remember your recipes for you. Save recipes you find on the web to your Chef's Hat account; you can then later search through your library of saved recipes and pull up the one you're looking for.
