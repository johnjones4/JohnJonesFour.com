This jQuery plugin helps you build single-scroll pages with complex scroll-based animations a la the NYTimes Snowfall feature. As the user scrolls, this plugin will animate the position of items based on the scroll position. To use it, you select various page elements, set the boundary points for their behavior, and then define a functor to compute the behavior.
