\_theInitialCommit is meant to be a medium for the personal stories of open source developers. Each published interview will feature multiple aspects of the individual: everything from his or her backgrounds, to why he or she got into development, to why he or she decided to become a contributor to the open source community.

The objective of the series is to show the pride and commitment these individuals have in the work they do, and that their work is meant for the good of the community.

If you are an open source contributor and would like to be interviewed, let me know using the contact form on this site.
